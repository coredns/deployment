First user is the kubernetes plugin. <br><br> plugin/kubernetes: Don’t do a zone transfer for NS requests <br><br> ***---DEPRECATIONS---***  <br><br> <ul> <li> The proxy will be moved to an external repository and as such be deprecated from the default set of plugin; use the forward as a replacement. </li> <li> the kubernetes plugin removes the resyncperiod option.</li></ul>
| v1.14 & v1.15        |  [v1.3.1](https://coredns.io/2019/01/13/coredns-1.3.1-release/)                   | TTL is also applied to negative responses (NXDOMAIN, etc). <br> <br> k8s_external a new plugin that allows external zones to point to Kubernetes in-cluster services. <br><br>kubernetes now checks if a zone transfer is allowed.
