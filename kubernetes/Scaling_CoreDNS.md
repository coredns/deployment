# Scaling CoreDNS in Kubernetes Clusters

The following is a guide for tuning CoreDNS resources/requirements in Kubernetes clusters.

## Memory and Pods

In large scale Kubernetes clusters, CoreDNS's memory usage is predominantly affected by the number of Pods and Services in the cluster. Other factors include the size of the filled DNS answer cache, and the rate of queries received (QPS) per CoreDNS instance.

### With default CoreDNS settings

To estimate the amount of memory required for a CoreDNS instance (using default settings), you can use the following formula:

>  MB required (default settings) = (Pods + Services) / 1000 + 54

This formula has the following baked in:

* 30 MB for cache. The default cache size is 10000 entries, which uses about 30 MB when completely filled.
* 5 MB operating buffer for processing queries.  In tests, this was the amount used by a single CoreDNS replica under ~30K QPS of load.

### With the *autopath* plugin

The *autopath* is an optional optimization that improves performance for queries of names external to the cluster (e.g. `infoblox.com`). However, enabling the *autopath* plugin requires CoreDNS to use significantly more memory to store information about Pods.  Enabling the *autopath* plugin also puts additional load on the Kubernetes API, since it must monitor all changes to Pods.

To estimate the amount of memory required for a CoreDNS instance (using the *autopath* plugin), you can use the following formula:

>  MB required (w/ autopath) = (Pods + Services) / 250 + 56

This formula has the following baked in:

* 30 MB for cache. The default cache size is 10000 entries, which uses about 30 MB when completely filled.
* 5 MB operating buffer for processing queries.  In tests, this was the amount used by a single CoreDNS replica under ~30K QPS of load.

### Configuring your deployment

You can use the formulas above to estimate the required amount of memory needed by CoreDNS in your cluster, and adjust adjust the resource memory request/limit in the CoreDNS deployment accordingly.

## CPU and QPS

Max QPS was tested by using the `kubernetes/perf-tests/dns` tool, on a cluster using CoreDNS. Two types of queries used were *internal queries* (e.g. `kubernetes`), and *external queries* (e.g. `infoblox.com`).  Steps were taken to synthesize the standard Pod behavior of following the ClusterFirst domain search list (plus one local domain). The effective domain search list used in these tests was `default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local mydomain.com`).  QPS and latency here are of the client perspective.  This is of special significance for external queries, wherein a single client query actually generates 5 backend queries to the DNS server, is counted only as one query.

### With default CoreDNS settings

Single instance of CoreDNS (default settings) on a GCE n1-standard-2 node:


| Query Type  | QPS              | Avg Latency (ms)   | Memory Delta (MB)   |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| external    | 6733<sup>1</sup> | 12.02<sup>1</sup>  | +5                  |
| internal    | 33669            | 2.608              | +5                  |


<sup>1</sup> From the server perspective it is processing 33667 QPS with 2.404 ms latency.

### With the *autopath* plugin

The *autopath* plugin in CoreDNS is an option that mitigates the ClusterFirst search list penalty.  When enabled, it answers Pods in one round trip rather than five. This reduces the number of DNS queries on the backend to one.  Recall that enabling the *autopath* plugin requires CoreDNS to use significantly more memory, and adds load to the Kubernetes API. 

Single instance of CoreDNS (with the *autopath* plugin enabled) on a GCE n1-standard-2 node:


| Query Type  | QPS   | Avg Latency (ms) | Memory delta (MB)    |
|-------------|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| external    | 31428 | 2.605            | +5                   | 
| internal    | 33918 | 2.62             | +5                   |


Note that the resulting max QPS for external queries is much higher.  This is due to the *autopath* plugin optimization.

### Configuring your deployment

All QPS loads above pegged both vCPUs (at ~1900m), implying that the max QPS was CPU bound. You may use the results above as reference points for estimating the number of CoreDNS instances to process a given QPS load.  Note that CoreDNS is also multi threaded, meaning that it should be able to process more QPS on a node with more cores. In these tests CoreDNS ran on nodes with two cores.  

## Data Sources

The formulas above were based on data collected from tests using the following setups:

**For Memory usage based on the number of Pods and Services:**

The following Kubernetes end-to-end presubmit tests (e2e):

* pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-big-performance: A 500 node cluster with 15000 Pods, 820 Services
* pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-large-performance: A 2000 node cluster with 60000 Pods, 3280 Services
* pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-scale-performance: A 5000 node cluster with 150000 Pods, 8200 Services

Version Info:
* Kubernetes version: 1.12-ish. These tests were running a version of Kubernetes built by the pre-submit tests in PRs to master on the tail end of the 1.12 release cycle.
* CoreDNS: 1.2.4 and 1.2.5

These pre-submit tests do not perform any QPS load, so cache and operating buffers were tested separately under load
and added to the max memory usage of each test to approximate real world memory usages.
The memory formulas above are based on a best fit linear trend of the following data points.

| Configuraiton  | Pod/Svc Count    | Max Memory (MB)    | Operating Buffer (MB) | Cache (MB) | 
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| default        | 0                | 19                 | 5                     | 30         |
| default        | 15820            | 31                 | 5                     | 30         |
| default        | 63280            | 76                 | 5                     | 30         |
| default        | 158200           | 154                | 5                     | 30         |
| autopath       | 0                | 19                 | 5                     | 30         |
| autopath       | 15820            | 62                 | 5                     | 30         |
| autopath       | 63280            | 178                | 5                     | 30         |
