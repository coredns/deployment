.SH "NAME"
\fIsecondary\fR \- enables serving a zone retrieved from a primary server\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
With \fIsecondary\fR you can transfer (via AXFR) a zone from another server\. The retrieved zone is \fInot committed\fR to disk (a violation of the RFC)\. This means restarting CoreDNS will cause it to retrieve all secondary zones\.

\fBZONES\fR zones it should be authoritative for\. If empty, the zones from the configuration block are used\. Note that without a remote address to \fIget\fR the zone from, the above is not that useful\.

A working syntax would be:

.nf

secondary [zones\.\.\.] {
    transfer from ADDRESS
    transfer to ADDRESS
    upstream ADDRESS\.\.\.
}
.
.fi

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBtransfer from\fR specifies from which address to fetch the zone\. It can be specified multiple times; if one does not work, another will be tried\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBtransfer to\fR can be enabled to allow this secondary zone to be transferred again\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBupstream\fR defines upstream resolvers to be used resolve external names found (think CNAMEs) pointing to external names\. This is only really useful when CoreDNS is configured as a proxy, for normal authoritative serving you don\'t need \fIor\fR want to use this\. \fBADDRESS\fR can be an IP address, and IP:port or a string pointing to a file that is structured as /etc/resolv\.conf\.

Transfer \fBexample\.org\fR from 10\.0\.1\.1, and if that fails try 10\.1\.2\.1\.

    secondary {
        transfer from 10\.0\.1\.1
        transfer from 10\.1\.2\.1

Or re\-export the retrieved zone to other secondaries\.

Only AXFR is supported and the retrieved zone is not committed to disk\.
