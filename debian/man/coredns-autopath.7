.SH "NAME"
\fIautopath\fR \- allows for server side search path completion\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If it sees a query that matches the first element of the configured search path, \fIautopath\fR will follow the chain of search path elements and returns the first reply that is not NXDOMAIN\. On any failures the original reply is returned\. Because \fIautopath\fR returns a reply for a name that wasn\'t the original question it will add a CNAME that points from the original name (with the search path element in it) to the name of this answer\.
